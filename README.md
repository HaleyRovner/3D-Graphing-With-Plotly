# 3D-Graphing-With-Plotly
python code to create a 3D, interactive scatterplot. This was created to show the data from a study by Professor Jim Proctor, but you can use it with any csv dataset.

## Setup
make sure that you have the latest version of python3 installed and have downloaded all of the libraries shown below:
- plotly.express
- chart_studio.plotly
- plotly.graph_objects
- pandas
- numpy
- csv
- plotly
- tkinter
- from tkinter import ttk

you can do this using ```pip install <library name>```

## To Run
To run the program, run the command ```python3 scatterplot.py``` in the directory where the file lives and it will automatically redirect you to your localhost. You can run this on or offline
